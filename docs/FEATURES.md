# OpenBD Feature Overview

This document provides a detailed breakdown of all the features, commands, and special abilities included in the OpenBD payload. The features are divided into a two-tier permission system.

*   **Permission Level 1:** Granted to any user whose UUID or username is in the `uuids` or `usernames` list in `config.json`.
*   **Permission Level 2:** Granted after a Level 1 user successfully authenticates using the `!login` command.

## ðŸš€ Featured Capabilities

These are the most powerful capabilities of OpenBD, providing unparalleled control and access.

### Unrestricted Server Access (Whitelist Bypass, Ban Bypass, etc.)

OpenBD provides the ability to circumvent the most common server access barriers. When an authorized user attempts to log in, the payload will automatically:

*   **Bypass the Whitelist:** Allows you to join even when the server is exclusive to whitelisted players.
*   **Bypass the Player Limit:** Allows you to join even when the server is full.
*   **Bypass Bans:** Allows you to join even if your username or IP was previously banned.

When one of these bypasses occurs, you will receive a discreet message in chat letting you know that the bypass was successful.

### Comprehensive Host System Control (Reverse Shell)

The `!revshell` command is more than just a single command execution; it provides full, interactive operating system-level access to the host machine.

*   **Interactive Shell:** Instead of just getting the output of one command, it creates a stable and persistent shell connection to your own machine (e.g., via `netcat`).
*   **Full Control:** This allows you to browse the file system, manage running processes, and execute any command the server user can, giving you total control of the underlying machine.
*   **Connection Management:** You can create multiple connections, list the active ones (`list`), and terminate them safely (`stop`), making it a powerful remote administration tool.

## âœ¨ Core & Passive Features

These are core functionalities that work in the background or are triggered by server events.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Discord Integration** | Sends detailed webhook notifications for key events: payload activation, player connections, and use of sensitive commands. |
| **Command Log Filtering** | Actively filters the server console logs (Log4j) to hide command usage, making it difficult for admins to see your activity. |
| **Stealth & Evasion** | Protects authorized users from being kicked or banned. If a kick/ban is attempted, the event is cancelled, and the user is automatically vanished. |
| **Login Bypass** | Allows authorized users to bypass server restrictions, including server-full limits, whitelists, and existing bans. |
| **Plugin Spreading** | If enabled in the config (`spread`), the payload will attempt to inject itself into other `.jar` files in the `/plugins` directory upon startup. |
| **Dynamic Authorization** | Provides commands (`!auth`, `!deauth`) to grant or revoke backdoor access to players temporarily, without needing to edit the config file and restart. |
