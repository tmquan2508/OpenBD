**OpenBD** is modern and powerful universal backdoor injector compatible with all Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/etc plugins. Its feature is ability to integrate with absolutely any plugin without the need to modify backdoor every time. Moreover, it provides powerful camouflage engine, which makes nearly impossible to find it without sufficient knowledge or advanced automated tools. OpenBD was developed to test the security systems of Minecraft servers, tmquan2508 is not responsible for its misuse.
