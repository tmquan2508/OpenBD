**OpenBD** is a modern and powerful universal backdoor injector for Minecraft server plugins. It is designed to be compatible with any Bukkit, Spigot, or Paper-based plugin, integrating seamlessly without requiring modification of the backdoor code for each target.

Its core strengths lie in a sophisticated camouflage engine that makes detection difficult without specialized knowledge or tools.

> **Disclaimer:** OpenBD was developed for educational purposes and to test the security of Minecraft servers. The author, tmquan2508, is not responsible for any misuse of this tool.
